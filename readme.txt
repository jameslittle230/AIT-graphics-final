Marble Blast Gold Clone
James Little - Computer Graphics Final Project

Adds a physics engine and control system to the 3D game from the previous 
assignment. User can control the marble with WASD, and can control camera with
arrow keys. Ball always rolls in direction the camera is facing, and rotation
is changed so it looks like the ball is rolling along the ground. Ball detects
collisions with objects: it will stay on top of platforms (and will roll off
tilted platforms), and can interact with gems.

The game adds a level system and a high score mechanic: the lowest completion
time for each level is kept track of.
